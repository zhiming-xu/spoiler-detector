      "The women are hot, things end there Yet another erotic thriller involving a web of lies and intrigue, this time around though there are no decent sex scenes to redeem it. Our protagonist must be one of the most lifeless human beings ever captured on celluloid. He has an incredibly good-looking wife that he never seems to look at or want to be with, but apparently he doesn't want to cheat on her with his co-worker either because damn it, the guy just really can't stand beautiful women. Back to incoherent rants about his work. The nudity is kept to an absolute minimum, which is pretty much the last thing you need in this sleazy kind of flick. Tawny Kitaen (or possibly her body double) has one brief nude scene, Shannon Whirry keeps her clothes on for the entire movie. That's just weird, is anyone really supposed to watch this for the gifted actors or the subtle writing? The ending is pretty inventive, I'll give it that. nan\n",
      "Go rent a playboy video I heard Tinto Brass did eroticism, fine. I heard he was a real artist using his film like a painting, fine. I can go on about the good things I've heard, now didn't I see s*** in this. A stylish porn? No, a boring porn that isn't really a porn more like odd voyeurism. The eroticism was so over bored it was more annoying and I'd say that it detracted from the plot, but there wasn't one. Had I wanted to watch a porno I'd'ave rented one. I expected a real movie with some nudity and sex not the other way around. Because there was so little and what there was was just so inane I'm just going to pretend like there weren't even characters. Now the cinematography, it was a bad spaghetti western quality. N ow I thought that Brass was supposed to be better than the spaghetti western directors, well he's actually worse. The shots were all bland and migraine worthy. I could go on. Then to really just make you hate the movie more the girl as the most irritating giggle I've ever heard (beside the fact it is a total sound bit)seriously after the first time I heard it I already wanted to punch her. I'll say this maybe his earlier stuff is better, but after this I really would have to doubt it. nan\n",
      "Erotic with an big E This must be one of the most erotic films ever made,if you like this , you must see the rest of Tinto Brass movies. Claudia Koll are playing an excellent roll, and she is SO sexy This film are very erotic , without going over the fine line between erotic and porn. I have seen and have most of the Tinto Brass erotic movies that are made , and I must say that I like that kind of movies where the ladies are natural and not filled up with silicon. So if you want an erotic ,sexy,hot movie, just get one of Tinto Brass and your evening will be saved. I have seen a lot of other erotic movies form all over the world, and I must say that I liked the erotic movies that came out in the USA in the 1970 was more erotic than the movies that are coming out today. todays movies have no humor. nan\n",
      "horrible male lead call me crass, but i preferred the higher titillation factor of \"Cheeky\", another anally fixated comedy from tinto brass...although \"all ladies do it\" has some witty moments (when compared to say, \"cheeky\"), they are destroyed by the hateful dubbing... i'm sure this movie has more appeal in its native language... next time someone transfers this to a boxed set, USE SUBTITLES! there are not enough genuinely erotic or explicit moments... it teases, to be sure, but the centerpiece of the movie is distinctly uninviting... a huge carnal disco on the outskirts of town, with enough freak factor to fuel the warhol factory... unfortunately, the synthesis of 80's dance music and bopping italians may make for some good laughs, but little excitement...the story is virtually identical to \"cheeky\" and \"monella\"... the bored wife of an \"uptight\" man (in brass world, anyone who doesn't get excited by his wife cheating on him) is intrigued by all the sexual tension around her, and decides to live in a state of hedonism... she does maintain that she reserves her love for her husband, but it takes awhile for him to come around to the idea...the main male character is horrible to watch... during the sex scenes, he grits his teeth, strains his neck muscles, and basically freaks out... not something you'd like to witness...once again, brass uses all his trademarks... mirror shots, overheads of black and white corridors, seduction in the toilet, urination, plenty of derrière, and laughable philosophy... normally i would smile and accept his vision of an impossibly ripe world, but this movie somehow disappoints, even with low expectations... some crisp and bold colours though... tinto could make a fortune filming washing powder ads... nan\n"
